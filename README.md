### What Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

### Continuous Integration brings multiple benefits:

* Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
* Increase visibility enabling greater communication
* Catch issues early
* Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
* Build a solid foundation
* Reduce integration problems

### The practices

* Maintain a single source repository
* Automate the build
* Make your build self-testing
* Keep the build fast
* Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable version
* Everyone can see whatâ€™s happening

### How you can do it

* Developers check out code into their private workspaces
* When done, commit the changes to the repository
* The CI Server (Travis) automatically monitors the repository and runs your unit and integration tests
* The CI server releases deployable artefacts for testing
* The CI server informs the team of the successful build
* If the build or tests fail, the CI server alerts the team to fixes the issuse.
